## Introduction

OpenBSD is an easy-medium Hack The Box machine where the attacker will require of an OpenBsd web exploit and a little bit of analyzing code in order to get the user flag and another  OpenBSD exploit about Xlock and (S/Key or YubiKey) in order to become root. 

## Enumeration

As always I start scanning every open port in the machine with **nmap**.

```bash
kali@kali:$ sudo nmap -v -sS -p- -n -oN AllPorts.txt 10.10.10.199
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.199
Host is up (0.048s latency).
Not shown: 65533 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http

Read data files from: /usr/bin/../share/nmap
# Nmap done at Sat Oct  3 11:56:39 2020 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 769.41 seconds
```

There are just two open ports, and the more in depth scan doesn't provide any useful information.

```bash
kali@kali:$ sudo nmap -sC -sV -p22,80 -n 10.10.10.199 -oN PortInDepth.txt
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-10-13 06:24 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.199
Host is up (0.060s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION

```

Hence, let's begin having a look at the web service, where there is an login portal.

![image-20201013122535219](assets/img/openkeys-htb/image-20201013122535219.png)

Using **gobuster** we can find the following folders.

```bash
kali@kali:$ gobuster -t 20 dir -u http://10.10.10.199/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -o directories.txt
/images (Status: 301)
/css (Status: 301)
/includes (Status: 301)
/js (Status: 301)
/vendor (Status: 301)
/fonts (Status: 301)
```

Inside the `/includes` folder there are two php files, one of them is the actual `auth.php` and the other is the recover file used by *vim* when a file is being edited.

![image-20201013123237486](assets/img/openkeys-htb/image-20201013123237486.png)

As you can see there is nothing inside the `auth.php` because is being executed by **OpenBSD httpd**.

![image-20201013123638506](assets/img/openkeys-htb/image-20201013123638506.png)

However, in the `auth.php.swp` we can see what is written in the `auth.php` file.

![image-20201013123742769](assets/img/openkeys-htb/image-20201013123742769.png)

In order to beautify the file we can download it, then using the tools *strings* and **vim** with the recover parameter `-r` , we can analyze the code pretty easily.

Firstly, we need to download the file using *wget*.

```bash
kali@kali:$ wget http://10.10.10.199/includes/auth.php.swp
```

Then, applying **strings** to the file provides a possible user name, a domain and path.

```bash
kali@kali:$ strings auth.php.swp
```

![image-20201013125610768](assets/img/openkeys-htb/image-20201013125610768.png)

Finally, using the **vim** editor we can see how the code works.

```bash
kali@kali:$ vim -r auth.php.swp 
```

![image-20201013125308184](assets/img/openkeys-htb/image-20201013125308184.png)

## Explotation

Searching in Goolge "OpenBSD authentication bypass" will appear a [post](https://www.secpod.com/blog/openbsd-authentication-bypass-and-local-privilege-escalation-vulnerabilities/) about how to bypass the authentication process to access the portal.

Long story short, you just need to change the user name and password for the word "-schallenge" in the post request using **burpsuite**.

![image-20201013132059785](assets/img/openkeys-htb/image-20201013132059785.png)

Now we have bypassed the authentication protocol we need to provide a valid session in order to retrieve an SSH key.

![image-20201013131804209](assets/img/openkeys-htb/image-20201013131804209.png)

Analyzing the before mentioned code there is a cookie named "username" that could be set in order to get a different session as "jennifer". In order to do so, we need to capture another authentication request adding the "username" cookie variable.

![image-20201013133235354](assets/img/openkeys-htb/image-20201013133235354.png)

Forwarding the request we get the Jennifer's ssh key.

![image-20201013133314485](assets/img/openkeys-htb/image-20201013133314485.png)

This key can be used to gain access to the machine as Jennifer obtaining the user.txt flag.

```bash
kali@kali:$ ssh -i jennifer.key jennifer@openkeys.htb
```

## Privilege Escalation

This virtual machine is running **OpenBSD 6.6**.

```bash
openkeys$ uname -a
OpenBSD openkeys.htb 6.6 GENERIC#353 amd64
```

Looking for  OpenBSD 6.6 privilege escalation exploits I found this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bcoles/local-exploits/blob/master/CVE-2019-19520/openbsd-authroot), executing the script for the [CVE-2019-19520](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcoles/local-exploits/master/CVE-2019-19520/openbsd-authroot) inside the machine we can become root getting the root flag, finishing the machine.

```bash
kali@kali:$ scp -i jennifer.key privEsc.sh jennifer@openkeys.htb:/tmp/
openkeys$ chmod +x privEsc.sh 
openkeys$ ./privEsc.sh
