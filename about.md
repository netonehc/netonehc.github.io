# History

The NetON EHC group was formalized on January 10, 2018 by a group of ETSIT students at the Polytechnic University of Valencia (Valencia, Spain) with the aim of learning and raising awareness in society about issues related to computer security. We are currently housed within the Spontaneous Generation program of the UPV.

All of its members consider ourselves self-taught, with international projection and we form a totally horizontal organizational structure, which means that we have no one above or below to send us, but that each one manages their time to meet the objectives that we set for ourselves. everybody.
